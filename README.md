## About

CarbO is an augmented reality (AR) app that shows the journey of carbon molecules during the Carbon Cycle. This application is intended to solve the abstractness problem in Biology because it can be difficult for students to understand how certain molecules, like carbon, play roles in our everyday world.Â 

## Technologies

* Unity 2020.1.6f1

## Setup

1. Download Unity Hub.

2. Install Unity at least version 2020.1.6f1

3. Set up your build settings through File -> Build Settings. For an android device, this is what we used. Building on a phone requires an android device, running android studio emulator, or xcode. Please set this up according to your device.

## Running the Project

Run the project with File -> Build and Run or CTRL + B.

## Notes
* Since AR and Unity is constantly changing, future students will need to update the project as time goes on. Please note, that the application may not work on future versions without adjusting.
